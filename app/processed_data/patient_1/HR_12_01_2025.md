**Lab Date**: 2025-01-13

| **Test**            | **Result** | **Reference Range**                                   |
|---------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Hemoglobin A1c      | 9.2%       | 4.0–5.6% (normal), <7.0% (ideal for diabetics)        |
| Fasting Glucose     | 186 mg/dL  | 70–99 mg/dL                                           |
| Creatinine          | 1.3 mg/dL  | 0.7–1.2 mg/dL                                         |
| eGFR                | ~68 mL/min | >90 mL/min (normal)                                   |
| LDL Cholesterol     | 120 mg/dL  | <100 mg/dL (goal)                                     |
| Triglycerides       | 180 mg/dL  | <150 mg/dL (optimal)                                  |
| TSH                 | 3.2 µIU/mL | 0.5–4.5 µIU/mL                                        |
| Potassium           | 4.2 mEq/L  | 3.5–5.0 mEq/L                                         |
| Sodium              | 140 mEq/L  | 135–145 mEq/L                                         |

- **Notes**:  
  - A1c indicates poor control of diabetes.  
  - LDL slightly above target range.  
  - Mild renal impairment suggested by creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL.

## 9. Imaging
1. **Chest X-Ray (2025-01-13)**  
   - **Attachment**: `IMG_CXRay_2025_01_13.jpg`  
   - **Findings**: Mild cardiomegaly, prominent pulmonary vasculature but no acute infiltrates or pleural effusion.

2. **Echocardiogram (2025-01-14)**  
   - **Attachment**: `IMG_Echo_2025_01_14.mp4`  
   - **Findings**: Mild left ventricular hypertrophy, ejection fraction ~55%, no significant valvular abnormalities.

3. **Lumbar Spine MRI (2023-09-10)**  
   - **Attachment**: `IMG_LSpineMRI_2023_09_10.jpg`  
   - **Findings**: Degenerative disc disease at L4-L5, mild spinal stenosis, consistent with chronic low back pain history.

## 10. Assessments & Diagnoses
1. **Poorly Controlled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus**  
2. **Hypertension (suboptimal control)**  
3. **Possible Early Heart Failure** (edema, mild cardiomegaly, and some signs of volume overload)  
4. **Hyperlipidemia** (LDL above goal)  
5. **Obesity**  
6. **Chronic Lumbar Pain** (degenerative disc disease and mild stenosis)

---

## 11. Treatment Plan
1. **Medications**  
   - **Adjust Insulin**: Increase nightly Insulin Glargine to 25 units; emphasize strict glucose monitoring.  
   - **Add Diuretic**: Initiate low-dose furosemide (20 mg daily) for fluid retention if edema persists.  
   - **Antihypertensive Optimization**: Consider increasing Lisinopril or adding a diuretic if BP remains >140/90.  
   - **Lipid Management**: Evaluate adding ezetimibe or increasing atorvastatin to 80 mg if LDL stays above 100 mg/dL.

2. **Lifestyle & Sport Interventions**  
   - **Nutrition Referral**: Consult with a dietitian for tighter glycemic control and weight reduction plan (~1–2 lb/week).  
   - **Exercise**: 30 minutes of moderate exercise (brisk walking, swimming) at least 5 days/week. Encourage low-impact sports such as cycling or swimming to reduce lumbar stress.  
   - **Physical Therapy**: Weekly sessions focusing on core strengthening and gentle stretching for low back pain.

3. **Additional Recommendations**  
   - **Foot Care**: Daily inspection of feet, comfortable footwear, prompt attention to any new lesions.  
   - **Blood Pressure Monitoring**: Home BP checks; keep a log.  
   - **Diabetes Education**: Reinforce self-monitoring of blood glucose, carbohydrate counting, and medication adherence.

---

## 12. Follow-Up & Monitoring
- **Next Appointment**: In 4 weeks to reassess blood pressure, edema, and glycemic control.  
- **Lab Recheck**: Repeat A1c and lipid panel in 3 months.  
- **Cardiology Referral**: If signs of heart failure worsen, consider advanced cardiac workup or medication optimization.
